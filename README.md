##  What is ETL?
ELTs is the abbreviation of “Extract”, “transform”, and “load”. This is a process where data is turned into something suitable for other purposes and packed into most commonly a data warehouse. The extraction could start from an application being used by the user and in the process generating data, or from a source. Which is crowded with the input of a data warehouse or even an active application.
